# Thesis
This repository contains the files used for my thesis project: __Deep Learning: A Statistical Perspective__. I tried to convey a statistical interpretation to deep learning in general and, in particular, of [Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01622). The code implements Neural Processes using the Pytorch library.

The folder is structured as follows:

*  [Thesis.pdf](https://github.com/lescipi/Thesis/blob/master/Thesis.pdf): the main file 

* [Presentation](https://github.com/lescipi/Thesis/blob/master/Presentation.pdf): the slides summarizing the main points 

* [Code](https://github.com/lescipi/Thesis/tree/master/Code) contains a [notebook](https://github.com/lescipi/Thesis/blob/master/Code/Neural_Process_Example.ipynb) which shows how to use Neural Processes with a toy example, and a [file](https://github.com/lescipi/Thesis/blob/master/Code/neural_process.py) where the two main classes (encoder and decoder) plus some utils functions are defined

* [Latex](https://github.com/lescipi/Thesis/tree/master/Latex) contains the latex source files to generate both the thesis and the presentation
